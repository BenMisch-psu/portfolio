        <p>Think <a href="about.html">link</a> here leads to the About page.</p>
        <p>You can also
                <strong>bold</strong> characters and create links to <a
                href="https://behrend.psu.edu/penn-state-behrend">external
            websites</a>.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">w3Schools</a> is a great resource for learning HTML.
            Here is a reference for <a href="https://htmlcolorcodes.com/">color codes you can use for styling</a>.</p>
        <p>P elements are a <strong>block</strong> element designed to make a block on the
            page.</p>
        <h2>What are block elements good for?</h2>
        <p>The next element after this is a ul, or <q>unordered list</q>. It makes a bulleted list.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>headings</li>
            <li>paragraphs</li>
            <li>lists</li>
            <li>tables</li>
            <li>images</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>How about we look at an ol element, or <q>ordered</q> list? The code looks very similar to the <q>unordered</q> list. 
            You have to see the difference by viewing in a web browser.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>morning</li>
            <li>noon</li>
            <li>afternoon</li>
            <li>evening</li>
            <li>night</li>
        </ol>
        <p> You can also add images to HTML files with ease. Such as:</p>
        <figure>
            <img src="images/bd-lilley-library-interior.jpg"/>
            <figcaption>Lilley Library at Penn State, Behrend. Remember to double check image types and don't just assume an image is a png just because other images in the folder are (like I may or may not have).</figcaption>
        </figure> 
    </body>
